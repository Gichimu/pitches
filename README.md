* The user clicks the login button and is redirected to the login page and if he/she already has an account he/she can provide the email and password and login, otherwise he/she is required to create an account by following the link provided.
* Once a user logs in with their credentials, the user can proceed to perform any of the tasks only allowed to accounts that have an account and are logged in like writting a comment and liking a pitch.
* The user can also proceed to view their profile whereupon they can create a pitch using the button provided on the left pane and view the pitches they have already created.
